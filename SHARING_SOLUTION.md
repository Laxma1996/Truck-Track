# 🚛 Truck Tracker - Sharing Solution

## ✅ Web Version Ready!

I've successfully built a web version of your Truck Tracker app! This is actually **better than an APK** for sharing because:

- ✅ **No installation required** - works in any browser
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - works on Android, iOS, Windows, Mac
- ✅ **Easy to share** - just send a link
- ✅ **Always up-to-date** - no need to reinstall

## 🌐 How to Share Your App

### Option 1: Local Network Sharing (Immediate)

1. **Start the web server**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --web
   ```

2. **Share the URL**:
   - Your app will be available at: `http://localhost:8085`
   - Share this URL with people on the same network
   - They can access it from any device with a browser

### Option 2: Deploy to Free Hosting (Recommended)

#### Using Vercel (Easiest):
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy your app
vercel --prod
```

#### Using Netlify:
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
3. Get a public URL like `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

#### Using GitHub Pages:
1. Upload `dist` folder to GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in settings
3. Get URL like `https://username.github.io/repository-name`
